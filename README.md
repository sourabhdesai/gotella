# GoTella

An implementation of the [Gnutella Protocol v0.4](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs425/gnutella_protocol_0.4.pdf) in [Go](http://golang.org/).

## Motivation
No practical reasons to make this. Gnutella isn't really used much anymore, much less this version of it, I know. Just wanted to have experience with creating a P2P system from scratch. Decided to use Go for the implementation so that I could gain more experience with using the language.
